    "# CS 124 Programming Assignment 1: Regular Expressions (`Winter 2023`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is your chance to become a __Dark Lord__ of spam email!\n",
    "Yes, you too can build regular expressions (`RegExes`) to spread evil throughout the galaxy. \n",
    "Our goal in this assignment is to use `RegExes` to extract phone numbers and\n",
    "email addresses from documents found on the web.\n",
    "This may seem easy at first, as you can write very simple `RegExes` to catch similar cases such as `650-723-0293` or `manning@cs.stanford.edu`.\n",
    "On the other hand there are various different ways people write their emails in `HTML` documents, some to prevent scrapers from capturing them easily, which you will learn in more detail in the upcoming sections.\n",
    "If you really were a malicious actor, you could then use these extracted addresses to bombard unsuspecting victims with spam!\n",
    "Of course, we would never do anything nefarious like that in `CS 124`. \n",
    "Instead our goal will be to work with raw data and gain some experience with `RegExes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a refresher on `Python` or `Jupyter Notebooks` (or you are new to\n",
    "either of them), we strongly encourage taking a look at `PA0` first.\n",
    "Referring back to it as you work might help if you run into any issues with\n",
    "`Python` syntax or idioms.\n",
    "We also provide you with a `Regular Expressions` tutorial (`regular_expressions_tutorial.ipynb`) along with this assignment, which can be helpful for practicing regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are encouraged to work with a partner!** We want the assignments in `CS 124` to bring you joy.\n",
    "One way to ensure this is to work with a partner!\n",
    "You are free to work with one other partner in our assignments.\n",
    "If you choose to work with a partner, we ask that each partner work on each part of the assignment in jointly instead of splitting parts.\n",
    "The partnership decision is independent for each assignment, so you can choose to work alone, work with the same partner or work with a different partner in the future assignments, which is a good way to meet your fellow classmates!\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will be able to get extra credit (EC) in this assignment!**\n",
    "We will have a leaderboard in this assignment, where you will be able to see how your solution compares against your classmates.\n",
    "You can name your leaderboard submission anything you would like, so you can stay anonymous to your classmates.\n",
    "We will give `1` unit of EC to the top `10` submissions to the leaderboard.\n",
    "The teaching staff will determine the exact number of points `1` unit of EC will correspond to at the end of the quarter."
