    "\n",
    "### Extracting Phone Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should be able to process text that looks like the examples shown\n",
    "on the left, and extract the phone number on the right (note that we want\n",
    "the result in a standardized form).\n",

    "<a href=\"contact.html\">TEL</a> +1&thinsp;650&thinsp;723&thinsp;0293 => 650-723-0293\n",
    "```\n",
    "__NOTE:__ You can assume we are only working with North American phone numbers,\n",
    "so all numbers will be of the form: [3 digit area code]-[3 digits]-[4 digits].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting Email Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the phone numbers, we are also interested in processing text\n",
    "containing (possibly obfuscated) email addresses and returning the corresponding\n",
    "email addresses in a standard form.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Ordinary email addresses\n",
    "manning@cs.stanford.edu => manning@cs.stanford.edu\n",

    "<script type=\"text/javascript\">obfuscate('stanford.edu','manning')</script> => manning@stanford.edu\n",

    "### Cases you won't have to worry about\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you should aim to make your regexes as powerful and general-purpose as\n",
    "you possibly can, there are some cases that are difficult or impossible to\n",
    "handle with regexes and which we don't expect you to be able to deal with.\n",

    "## Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started, here's some info about how your\n",
    "implementation will be tested and evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some General Comments on Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make your life easier on this (and future) homeworks, we will be\n",
    "giving you some data to test your code on, which we call a\n",
    "_development set_. Using a development set to test and evaluate your methods\n",
    "is an extremely common approach in natural language processing and machine\n",
    "learning. More generally, coming up with a robust set of test cases to\n",
    "evaluate your work against is also an extremely important part of writing\n",
    "good code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our development set is a bunch of HTML documents (the personal\n",
    "homepages of some Stanford CS professors) that we've scraped from the web and\n",
    "downloaded for you. If you're not familiar with the details of HTML or its\n",
    "syntax, that's fine. For the purposes of this assignment, all you need to know\n",
    "is that the inputs are text files (with some formatting) that contain the\n",
    "(possibly obfuscated) emails and phone numbers that we want to extract. You can\n",
    "find all of these HTML documents in the ```data/dev``` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the HTML documents, the ```data``` directory also contains\n",
    "another file, ```data/devGOLD```. You can think of this file as the answer key\n",
    "corresponding to the documents in ```data/dev```. It contains all the\n",
    "correctly extracted phone numbers and emails from all the documents in\n",
    "```data/dev```, in a particular format so your scripts (and our grading scripts)\n",
    "can read them easily. The format is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format of Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in the ```data/devGOLD``` file represents one extracted email address\n",
    "or phone number in the form of a 3-tuple. Each tuple is represented as 3 strings\n",
    "separated by tabs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jurafsky\te\tjurafsky@stanford.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first string is the name of the file in ```data/dev``` that\n",
    "the match came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second string is an 'e' if the match was an email address, or a\n",
    "'p' if it was a phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third string is the actual extracted email address or phone number itself,\n",
    "in the following standard form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  user@example.com\n",
    "  650-555-1234\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, the answers in the ```data/devGOLD``` file and the outputs\n",
    "generated by your implementation should take the form of Python tuples\n",
    "that look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  (filename, type, value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE:__ You don't have to worry about case sensitivity in your values\n",
    "(email addresses or phone numbers), since they will be normalized to lower case\n",
    "before being compared with the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade will consist of two parts, totalling 24 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, worth 16 points, scores how well your implementation does on the\n",
    "development set. For these examples you're given the correct answers,\n",
    "so you should aim get 100% of them correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of your grade, worth 8 points, will be based on how well your\n",
    "regular expressions find emails and phone numbers in a different set of examples,\n",
    "the test set. This test set is hidden and only the teaching staff knows what is\n",
    "on it! Because you don't know exactly what trickery goes on in this test set,\n",
    "you should be creative in looking at the web and thinking of different types\n",
    "of ways of encoding emails and phone numbers, and not just rely on the methods\n",
    "we've listed here, or are listed in the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not expected to perform perfectly on the test set as you don't know\n",
    "what is in it, or have the correct answers (just like in real life). As long as\n",
    "you manage to achieve some reasonable performance (compared to a benchmark that\n",
    "we provide), you'll get full points!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the equations we use to calculate the scores for the two parts, where\n",
    "`e` is the total number of errors (false negatives and false positives) for\n",
    "each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dev:__\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  if e < 10 then score(e) = 16 - e\n",

    "  if e >= 20      then score(e) = 3\n",
    "```\n",

    "hidden test set) is a very commonly used approach in machine learning!\n",
    "Evaluating on a development set where we have the \"right\" answers lets us\n",

    "\"out in the wild\", on examples that we might not have been able to tailor\n",
    "our methods to.\n",

    "### Checking your Dev Set Performance\n",

    "\n",
    "It compares the two and calculates how they overlap, printing out a\n",
    "bunch of information in the following form:\n",
